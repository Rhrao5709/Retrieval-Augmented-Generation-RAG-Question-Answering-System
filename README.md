# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-Question-Answering-System
Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that improves LLM responses by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base before generating answers. The project uses document embeddings, vector search, and context-aware generation, demonstrating skills in Python, NLP, vector databases, and LLM integration.
